<h1>Welcome To My First Page!</h1>
<p><strong>So perhaps I would be better at designing webpages than software?</strong></p>
<h3>"What do you currently do?"</h3>

<p>I am currently working as an industrial radiographer. I literally die a little bit every day that I am in this idustry lol. A little bit more insight to what I do, I basically check weld integrity by taking x-rays of pre and post production welds to make sure they arnt going to blow up and kill people... Im kinda important haha!</p>
<h3>"Well then what do you want to do?"</h3>

<p>In the past few months I have disovered through a few of my friends that without any formal training, I could break into a very lucrative programming career. All it would take was time and dedication. If all it takes for me to make about double what im making now is time and dedication, than color me dedicated! This is the oppurtunity I have been searching for. See, I never <strong>REALLY</strong> wanted to work in the industrial field in the first place. I jumped into it because my wife and I were unexpectedly blessed with our beautiful baby boy and I needed to step up as the provider. So I have worked my self to reputable posistion in a career I didnt want haha. With no extra money or time for school I have felt trapped in this career. So God willing, maybe I can make a programmer out of myself! </p>

<p>Well... I havnt really decided yet. about a month ago I started learning python3. I have been able to write a few silly little programs that can be found at my github account <a href="https://github.com/Bashworth16?tab=repositories">Here</></a>. But I have pretty much hit a wall. My next step was to start leaning Tkinter. But I found my self very confused. I refuse to give up because in reality if I am going to make a career out of this I would prefer to be very well versed in each aspect of programming.</p>
<P>In efforts of self exploration, I have recently started dabbling in html. Hence this page haha. I am currently making this Mock webpage at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-LceTK/0/6" >This Site</></a>. I do want to be versed in every aspect of programming, but right now I need to find my niche. Something that I can be pretty good at reletivley quickly so that I can be looking at a career change in 2017(MY GOAL).</p>
